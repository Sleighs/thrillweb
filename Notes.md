How to Focus for 12+ hours a day like a millionaire - Charlie Morgan - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dW1x4lTqPw&ab_channel=CharlieMorgan

- Identity
  - Resistance is a force you create to prevent yourself from becoming successful.
  - in order for you to achieve you goal your former identity ego you must form a new identity. The ego gets scared, it's just fighting to survive.
  - subconscious and ego/identity doesn't want to change 
- How to eliminate the previous part of ourselves to grow the new?
  - 2 ways = pain or/and affirmation
  - pain 
    - pain is when resistance meets effort
    - anything that prevents work is resistance
    - Effort = will
    - only way to create pain (not physical) is to create resistance
    - physchological coup - must remove the previous 
    - pain is the sword to kill former self
  - affirmation
    - affirmation creates the new identity
  - any time you experience resistance you can create pain
  - When you apply effort to achieve your goal you form new identity
  - Belief system manifests through actions

- resistance
  - fear
  - doubt
  - not working to learn
  - researching - not working to research
  - comfort - not working because you're comfortable
  - waiting - not working to wait to see if things change
  - criticism - not working because you're afraid of peoples criticism
  - support - dont feel have enough support or accountability partner
  - entitlement - because you feel entitled not to work
  - routine - not working because no coffee
  - self-love - not working to avoid pain
- (from other video maybe?) Illness and injury consumes body's focus to manage the condition and stress 
- Time is limited
- Carbs and sugar use up energy
- Write down distractions
- Meditation for 20 min
- All or nothing - Become focused and obsessed on finishing things (Ex. song, movie, chess match, replying to email)
  - train brain to singletask, not multitask
- Remove distractions from environment
  - Environment is more powerful than willpower. Environment always wins long term. (if you have cigarettes in your house you're eventually going to smoke)
  - Remove extra tabs
  - Phone apps, desktop apps
  - 
- "If you dont understand resistance (procrastination, doubt, fear, judgement), if you cant define its first principle, you're never going to fix this problem. You're always going to exist in this cycle of up-and-down, self-sabotage and self-hatred." 4min

A coup against your former self
- The only thing you have, to destroy and assassinate the current version of yourself is pain. Every time something in this and you do with effort, part of the former you dies.

Identities form belief systems
Belief systems manifest in actions

In order for you to kill something it is done through pain

- Visualize

***
How I found purpose in my life?

Vision is a state of a future applied radical change

Wants reflect character

Billionaires typically become millionaires through solving big problems

***

Things to remove

  - puts brain in rollercoaster mode
    - emotion is the enemy to business

Pain and resistance - Charlie Morgan

Former self causes resistance from fear of changing.
The more pain you overcome the faster you grow.
Seek as much pain as possible.

Without pain and suffering you cannot become.

Look at it, lock eyes, don't look away.
